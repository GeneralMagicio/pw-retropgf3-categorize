  "contributionDescription": "I first learned about the Blockchain in 2021, and by then, some of the projects had already been conceived. As I get to know what a smart contract is, Optimism airdrops had reached many wallets as incentives. \nBut now, I have made a couple test on the Ethereum Networks layer 1 and 2. This account is even recently created after the one I had was compromised by phishing attacks. Hence, I'm still new, and I hope there's retroactive reward I missed somewhere.\nReal utility\nThanks for this opportunity",
