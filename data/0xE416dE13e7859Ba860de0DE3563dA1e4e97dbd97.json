Any Optimism dapp developer can list their dapps on DappRadar to showcase their activity to DappRadar’s blockchain-educated audience. This allows users to discover new Optimism dapps and identify the next project to use and invest in, educating and bridging DappRadar users into the Optimism ecosystem. \nAdditionally, DappRadar has made more integrations and support for Optimism Collective dapps by integrating the biggest Superchain - Base in August 2023, providing even more insights to users. On top of that, the team at DappRadar created numerous pieces of content to highlight positive Optimism activity within the dapp industry.",
