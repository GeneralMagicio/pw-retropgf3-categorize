  "impactDescription": "Hope to fill more in future. Let me start an learning the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nThese two things I will try to support: \n\nUser acceptance: The success of Optimism also depends on user acceptance. DApps and users must be willing to use Layer-2 solutions and rely on them. This often requires seamless integration and a user-friendly interface.\n\nEthereum integration: Integration with the Ethereum blockchain is of great importance. Optimism aims to be compatible with Ethereum, but it is important that the two interact well and work together smoothly.",
