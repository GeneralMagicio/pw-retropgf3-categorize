  "impactDescription": "My contributions have had a substantial impact on the Optimism Collective in Chinese community. I authored various articles and engaged in podcasting to amplify the importance of the digital public goods, encouraging users to actively participate in Optimism ecosystem. Additionally, I explored RetroPGF concepts, underlining its commitment to supporting public goods.\n\nFor example, my extensive coverage of RetroPGF included an article on 'Simulated Voting.' This aimed to provide readers with a firsthand understanding of the challenges faced by badgeholders when evaluating 195 projects within a tight timeframe. Additionally, I underscored the distinction between retroactive funding, which rewards based on outcomes, and traditional investments, which are based on expectations of future impact.",
