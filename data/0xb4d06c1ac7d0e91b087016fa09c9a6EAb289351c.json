This enables human-readable insights and scam protection for all transactions our users do on Optimism. To date we've protected $40m+ in assets from being stolen from phishing scams for Optimism and EVM users alike.\n\nOur security engine has also protected our users from 50+ fake Optimism websites in the last month and a half alone. See the attached Notion document for more information. These are confirmed websites that have malicious intent such as draining a users' wallet.",
