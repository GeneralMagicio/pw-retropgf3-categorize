  "impactDescription": "The Optimism Collective believes that building public goods should be rewarded.\n\nThis key ingredient to the Optimistic vision (opens new window)is more than just altruism – it’s core to our success. Optimism’s codebase itself is an open-source project, and builds on the shoulders of countless OSS giants which came before it.\n\nThis means public goods funding is a critical growth strategy. For Optimism, well-funded public goods means better developer tooling, widespread user education, safer infrastructure, and industry-leading research. It means Optimism can last and thrive.",
