  "contributionDescription": "Titanoboa makes it possible to run comprehensive and granular tests on a smart contract suite. Besides coverage reports, print statements, a fork mode, time travel, EVM state patching, Titanoboa offers advanced testing features such automated fuzzing strategies and custom precompiles. Opcode patching also enables testing new EVM opcodes to test contracts on different versions of the EVM, such as Mainnet vs Optimism.\n\nTitanoboa's highly optimized backend can reduce the time it takes to run a test suite from several hours to under a minute. Boa does so by replacing slow external RPC calls with an embedded EVM running contracts directly as Python.\n\nIntegration with Jupyter means that one can spin up a notebook on Google Collab and start collaborating and prototyping their smart contract idea.",
