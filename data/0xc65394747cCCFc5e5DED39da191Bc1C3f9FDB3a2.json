  "impactDescription": "Utilizing ZK technology, Tusima zkBridge securely transmits the source chain’s status to the destination chain. Users can directly access the source chain certificate on the destination chain and independently verify it, thereby enhancing security. Throughout the entire proof process of Tusima zkBridge — starting from ‘Chain A → Sender → zkRelayer → ZK Verifier → Receiver → Chain B’ — verification of information transfer relies solely on mathematical and cryptographic formulas. Once the code is successfully deployed, no external forces can affect or interfere with this cross-chain process.",
