  "contributionDescription": "Over the last three years Republik Rupiah has been one of the primary voices in Indonesia, educating people on blockchain technology, with a strong focus on the Ethereum Ecosystem. Not only were we one of the first voices to educate in this space in the country, but we also taught what layer two's were before any were created.\n\nWe have done this by walking new people through the ecosystem and also existing communities through an educational journey. We were one of the first voices to cover Optimism and the OP tech stack. We encouraged people to participate in the ecosystem from a very early stage and made detailed educational content on how to interact with the platform, including adding the chain to existing wallets and bridging assets, as well as using the dApps that had migrated.",
