  "contributionDescription": "We are the creators and maintainers of Waffle, a framework for testing smart contracts. Multiple repositories in the Optimism ecosystem are dependent on Waffle. Waffle provides a clean and simplified way to write tests for Ethereum smart contracts. It abstracts away much of the boilerplate code, making it easier to focus on the actual test logic and improving overall ecosystem security and reliability. Waffle is one of the most popular testing libraries. It has helped many projects and developers keep their smart contracts secure and well-tested. \n",
