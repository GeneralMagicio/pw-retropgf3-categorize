  "contributionDescription": "I organized an event to share how blockchain technology can be used alongside a data indexing solution like The Graph to build useful applications in a more accessible way. I explained what Optimism is, especially OPSTACK, and how it functions as a layer 2 solution that can deploy Ethereum applications more quickly and cost-effectively. I also provided concrete examples of how The Graph and Optimism could be applied together, such as to create decentralized marketplaces or DeFi apps. With the goal of bringing these technologies to more developers in Latin America, I also shared Spanish-language community channels where people can learn about and get involved in blockchain projects.",
