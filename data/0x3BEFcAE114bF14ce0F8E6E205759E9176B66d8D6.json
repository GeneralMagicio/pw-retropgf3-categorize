  "bio": "OP Reth is Reth but for the Optimism Collective, a new high performance client.",
  "contributionDescription": "The OP Stack is built to be modular, and allows any EL to plug as long as it's following the spec. We proceeded to adjust Reth, a new EL for Ethereum, to be compatible with the OP Stack by adding support for Deposit transactions, the new Engine API modifications and more. This brings down OP Stack chain sizes down by >5x and provides improved runtime performance which we have yet to benchmark concretely vs OP Mainnet.\n\nhttps://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/4377",
