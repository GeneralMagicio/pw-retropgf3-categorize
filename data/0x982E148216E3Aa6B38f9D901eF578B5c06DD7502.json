  "contributionDescription": "Beam is an attempt at what a Superchain wallet should look like. It solves the user confusion that can result from assets spread across multiple rollups. Beam’s ‘Supersend” feature is fully operational and has already proven that a solution to this challenge exists and that it can be delivered to users in a tool that is fast, cheap and a delight to use — with more than 70,000 users saving access to their Beam wallets.
