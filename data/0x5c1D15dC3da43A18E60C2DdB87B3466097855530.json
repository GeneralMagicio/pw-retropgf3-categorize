  "contributionDescription": "I invested substantial time creating an Optimism Governance Dashboard on Dune that enables real-time tracking of proposals, participation statistics, voting trends, and delegate activity to promote transparency in Optimism's on-chain governance. My dashboard visualizes key metrics like total proposals, votes cast, voter involvement over time, top delegate voting power and participation ratios, inactive delegate counts, and underrated but active delegates. It allows querying single-delegate's voting histories and power changes. I also created tables summarizing all proposals and delegate profiles for easy reference.",
