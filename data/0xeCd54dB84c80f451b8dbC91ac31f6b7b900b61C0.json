It can be used for the qualification of ecosystem members through a transparent, fair, and data-driven approach. Thus providing better governance access for public goods funding to verified regen actors across the wider web3 ecosystem. \n\nCurrent contributions include:\n\n- Analytical model for behaviour scoring described in documentation and supported by statistical sampling\n- A website for checking out your score and minting the on-chain attestation (including a schema, with separate scoring just for OP behaviours) (open source)\n- A series of communications with the OP and web3 community for feedback and engagement over various channels",

  "impactDescription": "The key impact we see so far is a good number of motivated and high-performing potential candidates for the citizen house:\n\n- Within a limited communication campaign the number of good candidates is already comparable to the current citizen house, proving the growth potential\n- Scores vary, but a median score of attested users is close to the level of the current OP Delegates (based on the formula and on-chain stats) \n- Users needed to pay a small fee on OP (to cover the fees for the on-chain writing), so it meant they had funds on the OP chain and were engaged in the reputation/governance game",
