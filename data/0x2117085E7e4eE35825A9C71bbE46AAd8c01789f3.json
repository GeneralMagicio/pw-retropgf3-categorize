  "contributionDescription": "My contributions can be broadly categorized into two areas: supporting developers and assisting end-users.\n\nFor the developer, being one myself, I've aided an uncountable amount of projects by sharing my expertise on how to develop and establish businesses on Optimism, as well as on other blockchains within the Superchain ecosystem.\n\nFor end-users, I've facilitated the onboarding of thousands and continuously provided education, especially regarding technical aspects. This includes guiding users on how to avoid exploits and advising on measures to take in the event of a hack.\n\nFor the record, I was a person who spotted an early exploit in Quixotic's NFT Marketplace, aiding in damage control and preserving the Optimism ecosystem's integrity.
