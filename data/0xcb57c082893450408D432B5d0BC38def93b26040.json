  "bio": "I work at Dune helping build the best analytics product in crypto. Outside of work, I build things for fun. Most recently built Slugs, an onchain URL shortener.",
  "contributionDescription": "Slugs is the first URL shortener purpose-built for an onchain world.\n\nThe protocol is supported by a smart contract deployed on Optimism Mainnet, and a frontend which acts as an interface to the protocol and as a resolver to redirect requests to the right URL.\n\nThe Slugs protocol is a public good URL shortener with a series of unique properties which can only exist under an onchain paradigm: immutable aliases, censorship-resistant registrations, permanent ownership, tokenization of aliases allowing trade-ability, and referrer fees enshrined into the protocol.",

  "impactDescription": "Slugs is a new crypto primitive for minting NFTs with offchain utility at no cost, with a commonly understood use case outside of crypto (Bit.ly but onchain).\n\nIn order to make crypto more accessible and onboard the next 1 billion users, I believe we need to create more protocols that solve relatable problems with better UX and at a lower cost. My contribution is an attempt at a tiny step in that direction.\n\nThe project is launching this week so I am not including any traction numbers. Instead, a link to a Dune dashboard is included. Check it out to see its most up to date impact data.",
