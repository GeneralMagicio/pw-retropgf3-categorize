Collaborating with my co-researchers at 4Pillars, we've initiated a series on Modular Blockchains. My specific focus lies in Rollup Economics, where I analyze the Cost, Revenue, and Profit Models of layer-2 blockchains, including Optimism, zkSync, and zkEVM. These efforts aim to provide valuable insights into Optimism's economic aspects and its role in the blockchain ecosystem.",
