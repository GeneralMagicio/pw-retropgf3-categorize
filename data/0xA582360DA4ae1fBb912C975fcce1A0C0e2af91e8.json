  "contributionDescription": "Surreal addresses key pain points for both regular crypto users and the wider retail audience by offering a seamless L2 mobile experience. Our proven track record, with 1k users in just a month and strong engagement metrics, shows our ability to attract and retain users. By introducing in-app minting and free daily mints on Optimism, we're poised to not only enhance user engagement but also introduce many to the Optimism ecosystem before they explore Ethereum. Our emphasis on user-friendly crypto tech, collaborations, and a clear \"L2-first\" approach (we support major OP Stack: Base and Zora chains) uniquely positions Surreal to significantly boost the adoption and expansion of the Optimism platform.",
