I don't miss a single round.\n\n- Being a major Influencer and having some connections in the crypto community at the same time, I periodically actively recommend Optimism to my audience and colleagues (always from the bottom of my heart).\n\n- I am a fairly early user of the Optimism network (since November 2022), actively participating in all activities - for example, I have completed all Optimism quests.\n\n- Within 3 months we plan to start developing our own project on Optimism. At the moment we are at the stage of forming a team, funding has already been raised.",
