  "contributionDescription": "There are 4 pages in the table I provided - YouTube, Telegram, Union and Academy\n\nUnion is a private community with 600 people paying participation fees on a monthly basis. So the most interested target audience but I'm unable to give you links since it's a private community\n\nAcademy is an information product. There's also a target audience with money that we're teaching from scratch how to interact with the Web3 world. Same with links as it is in Union\n\nStats:\nYoutube channel: 197k+\nTelegram channel: 72k+\nPrivate TG channel: 650+\nAcademy: 1,3k+\n\nWe made 4 videos on YouTube(maybe even more but that's where OP tokens are shown at least on a Thumbnail)\n\nWe mentioned 28 times OP in our Telegram and made 11 posts literally about Optimism and 3 times mentioned in Daily Digest - it's a podcast\n",
