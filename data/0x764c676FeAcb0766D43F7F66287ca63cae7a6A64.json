  "impactDescription": "* Seedle added support for Optimism as soon as Uniswap V3 launched on Optimism.\n* It was also one of the first UIs that showed positions across networks, which promoted Optimism for LPs who haven't discovered it before.\n* Seedle also includes gas costs when calculating position gains, this helps LPs to choose between mainnet and L2s when deploying their liquidity.",
