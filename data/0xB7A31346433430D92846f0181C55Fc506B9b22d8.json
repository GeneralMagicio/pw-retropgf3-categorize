Our latest launch, MultiSafe letâ€™s users deploy a Safe with the same address on most chains including Optimism.\n\nThis grant would help retroactively fund our team for the six dapps now live on Optimism while also bringing dump.services to Optimism and developing new apps for the OP ecosystem. \n\nRecent Smol highlights include MultiSafe being featured in Blockworks and our token dumping dapp (Dump.services) surpasing $4.2M in volume within the first 4 months.\n\n",
