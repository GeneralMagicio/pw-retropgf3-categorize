  "contributionDescription": "RetroList provides an alternative to the RetroPGF List Creation UI, using a rubric-based approach to allocate OP to projects. RetroList is open to the public, allowing everyone to create their own lists and contribute to RetroPGF3.\n\nRetroList differs from Supermodular's list creation UI in two major ways:\n1. RetroList utilizes rubric-based scoring\n2. RetroList is open to the public, enabling everyone to create their own lists\n\nRetroList implement a novel approval mechanism to filter out spam efficiently as follows:\n1. Users connect their Twitter and Discord and create a list -> Status: Draft (Hidden)\n2. Our team does a preliminary review -> Status: Qualified (Show only in our UI)\n3. A badgeholder approves the list -> Status: Approved (Usable in the ballot)",
