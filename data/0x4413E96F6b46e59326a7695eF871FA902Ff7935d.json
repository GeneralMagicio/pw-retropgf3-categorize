  "contributionDescription": "Nimbus is a client implementation for both Ethereum’s consensus layer and execution layer that strives to be as lightweight as possible in terms of resources used. This allows it to perform well on embedded systems, embedded devices – including Raspberry Pis and mobile devices.\n\nHowever, resource-restricted hardware is not the only thing Nimbus is good for. Its low resource consumption makes it easy to run Nimbus efficiently in L2 networks with higher throughput that may require additional workloads on the same server.\n\nNimbus is trying to accelerate the development of L2 protocols such as OP through the ongoing work on EIP-4844.",
