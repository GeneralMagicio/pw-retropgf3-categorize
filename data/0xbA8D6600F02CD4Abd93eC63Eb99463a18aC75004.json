  "contributionDescription": "Optimistic Alpha is a weekly curation that Provides my audience with on-chain and off-chain activities that can boost their reputation on-chain and also reward them within the Optimism ecosystem.\nI have a community where we share Optimism-related alphas. I discovered it was hard for people to keep up with different activities and that's how I gave birth to the OPTIMISTIC ALPHA.\nI share these Alphas beyond the community. I put them up on my Mirror, X, and my other socials (Farcaster, FriendTech, and Lens) so as to get to a wider audience.\n\nIn my Mirror profile, I have other OP-related articles shared.\n\nLastly, I held a couple of Twitter Spaces as an Optimism ambassador-in-training with projects building and are willing to build on OP to discuss their project and the importance of RetroPGF.",
