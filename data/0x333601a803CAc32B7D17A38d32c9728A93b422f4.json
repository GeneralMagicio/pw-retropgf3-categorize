  "contributionDescription": "flink is a consumer app / interface for Farcaster, which has identity ownership stored on-chain on OP mainnet. flink has been responsible for onboarding the majority of Farcaster uses by a wide margin since Farcaster moved to permissionless signups. This has in turn generated revenue for the protocol, all while being a self-funded side project.\n\nflink is differentiated from other clients by providing value to the existing web3 userbase. flink allows for anyone to simply connect a wallet and onboard to Farcaster by registering on OP mainnet. flink also provides rich embeds for users to transact (such as mint NFTs) through flink across a number of chains with the users sharing the links earning referral rewards through supported platforms like Zora and mint.fun.",

  "impactDescription": "flink has been built with a focus on crypto-native consumers, many of which have already been a part of the Collective. Therefore, the main contribution is allowing these members to be able to permissionlessly onboard to Farcaster and participate in discussions through a client that is more familiar to their day-to-day web3 experiences. flink also allows for those who onboard to have a richer social experience by providing transaction embeds directly within the client experience for discovery and minting on shared NFTs.",
