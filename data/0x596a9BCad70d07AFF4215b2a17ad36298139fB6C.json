  "impactDescription": "We heightened awareness within the Mexican community by having Optimism as a prominent sponsor of Ethereum Mexico 2023. Mark Tyneway's insightful talk on the future of blockchain technology piqued interest and extended an invitation to engage with the Collective.\n\nIn Season 4, we actively participated in a mission, exceeding the expected impact. While we committed to 4 events, we went above and beyond, supporting local communities in organizing a total of 12 events across 9 diverse cities. Additionally, we exceeded expectations with more X threads and X Spaces than initially projected. Our efforts resonated, amplifying Optimism's presence and reach.",
