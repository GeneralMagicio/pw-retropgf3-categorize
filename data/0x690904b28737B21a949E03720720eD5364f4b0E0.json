It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that Optimism pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that Optimists love. **If you’re providing impact, you are eligible!**\n\nYour application will be used by badgeholders to decide on how much OP you should receive **based on the impact you already had on the Optimism Collective**. We recommend you take time to fill out your application and start early.\n\n**Note**: You are only evaluated based on the impact you already had. Do not mention or allude to your future work or future impact. This is **retroactive** public goods funding, not proactive funding!",

This allows RetroPGF to fairly compensate impact to the Collective.\n\n**The more accurate this information is, the more likely you will receive the right amount of RetroPGF.** You only need to add information about grants or revenue related to the contributions you’re looking to receive RetroPGF for.\n\n- List funding and grants that directly or indirectly relate to your contribution\n    - Did you receive a grant for your contribution?\n    - Did users pay for your contribution?\n    - Did you receive donations for your contribution?\n- If you received a grant from the Token House (Missions, grants council, etc.), you must report this under the “Governance fund”",
