  "contributionDescription": "Onboarded strategic communities and creators with massive audiences all around the world to Optimism and RPGF. These communities did not previously promote Optimism nor were they familiar with Public Goods and Public Goods funding mechanism like RPGF. Weâ€™ve put lots of effort into showing how much impact their work has created through onchain activity. Mirror mints, NFT badges as certificates of completion, free OP mints as proof of attendance (like POAPs, but on OP) . I cannot claim the impact these creators make, only spending months onboarding and guiding their Optimistic Vision mission. ",
