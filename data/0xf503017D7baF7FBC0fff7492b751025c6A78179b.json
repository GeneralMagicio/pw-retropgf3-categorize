  "contributionDescription": "TrueBlocks built a fully decentralized, open-source data indexing solution available to EVM-based blockchains (Optimism, Ethereum Mainnet, and others).\n\nUsers who want censorship-resistant, private, cheap, and fast access to unquestionably accurate chain data–free of any intermediaries and their direct or indirect costs–use TrueBlocks' local-first software.\n\nTrueBlocks uniquely enables Optimism and Ethereum users of all types to:\n\n- Build complete indexes as it looks for “every appearance of every address on the blockchain,”\n- Access pre-built indexes via IPFS and TrueBlocks’ Unchained Index smart contracts, which cheaply and equitably share the index for the public good,\n- Retrieve their on-chain data directly, cheaply, and quickly with consumer-grade hardware.\n\n",

  "impactDescription": "TrueBlocks gives users a viable and scalable indexing alternative that:\n\n- Does not compromise on Optimism's nor Web 3.0’s core values of decentralization, open access, and data sovereignty.\n- Helps reduce the community’s reliance on web 2.0-like data intermediaries that put us at risk of censorship, user capture, privacy invasion, and rent-seeking,\n- Expands the utility of the node software, giving users another reason to run a node, thereby promoting decentralization,\n- Inspires node enhancement via EIP proposals and demonstrates how true decentralization can work,\n- Better insulate the entire community from regulatory overreach.\n",
