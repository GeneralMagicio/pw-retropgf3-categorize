  "contributionDescription": "We are a team of researchers and developers, dedicated to the Ethereum ecosystem. We are recognized for having partnered with some of the most successful and promising projects operating on Optimism, such as Yearn, Connext and HAI; and have collaborated closely with the Optimism team for several projects (Smock and our soon-TBA Prophet).\n\nWe believe that true DeFi should be open, permissionless, and decentralized. To realize this vision, we have contributed to the creation of public goods over time. For retroPGF3, we're submitting our set (12) of freely available open-source libraries and tools that facilitate the secure process of creating protocols for permissionless finance. These tools meet the highest security standards and industry best practices.",
