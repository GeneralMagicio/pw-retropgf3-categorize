  "contributionDescription": "As a leading identity data provider on Optimism, Clique has issued 1.14M out of total 1.49M attestations on OP AttestationStation, which are then used by major OP ecosystem protocols like Bungee, Tally, BoredTown, Clipper, Synapse, Perpetual, Orbiter, Aloe, Angle, and many others, for purposes like user screening, Sybil resistance, directional incentive issuance, etc. The attestations encompass users' Twitter metrics, GitHub prowess, Discord interactions, and on-chain behaviors.\nWe actively bring technical innovations to the OP ecosystem such as building the first-ever ZKP-based attestations, TEE-based web2 data attestations, as well as identity-based governance processes. In addition, we are an active contributor to the OP governance itself as a part of its protocol delegation program.",

  "impactDescription": "Clique has greatly pushed forward the adoption of on-chain Attestions on OP as the largest attester with >75% of the market share. Our OP Army program in May resulted in 1.2-2.7% of Optimism’s total tx in six weeks. We've substantially aided partner protocols: 350k deposited on Clipper’s LP, 13k accounts for Tally, etc. \nAs OP Army’s goal was to identify experienced web3 users, we’ve discerned ~10k skilled users from 59k participants post rigorous Sybil checks through our collabs with core DeFi and NFT protocols. Our novel AEE (Attestation Exclusive Events) rewards these 10k with added benefits to incentivize more value creation. Clique's current focus is around further expanding attestation use cases on OP by pinpointing DeFi power users and creating credit attestations using CeFi data.",
