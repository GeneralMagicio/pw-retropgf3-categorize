The protocols built into the libp2p project such as the Kademlia DHT and Gossipsub are core functions in the Ethereum and OP mainnet blockchains.\n\nThe libp2p maintainers have identified and mitigated 8 critical security bugs since 2019 and coordinated the private deployment of the fixes with members of the Optimism ecosystem. The maintainers continually optimized and fixed bugs with a steady cadence of libp2p releases in multiple implementations. The project has also maintained interop and performance testing to further identify and fix bugs across implementations, including go-libp2p used in OP mainnet.",
