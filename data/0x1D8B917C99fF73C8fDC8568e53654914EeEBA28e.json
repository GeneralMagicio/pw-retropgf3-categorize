  "impactDescription": "Anotherworld will create an ancient world, introducing characters from Xia, Shang, Zhou and other dynasties, and giving biographies to the characters and even surrounding physical items. Bringing antique-loving users into the crypto world.\n\nThis idea comes from a very popular movie in China this year called \"Chang'an 30,000 Miles\". The box office of this movie reached 250 million US dollars. After watching the movie, I immediately bought the accompanying \"Chang'an 30,000 Miles\" art set. I think Chinese users have demand for ancient style NFT PFP, even though the NFT market is currently in a downturn.",
