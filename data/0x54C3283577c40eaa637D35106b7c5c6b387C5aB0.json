  "contributionDescription": "MusicTribes pioneers the mode of interaction within the Optimism music ecosystem, bridging artists, collectives, and fans. It aggregates NFTs from platforms like Sound.xyz, Catalog, Zora, Lens and others. Unlike traditional platforms, recommendations are defined externally by tokenized communities' input parameters. Users get content based on the community tokens they hold, avoiding conventional algorithm-driven models and fostering direct artist-to-fan engagement. This empowers artists and utility for community members, with the potential for communities to earn referral fees. Most communities have minted their tokens on the Optimism blockchain. Music Tribes also incorporates artists' Mirror articles, integrating another OP platform. Music Tribes onboards web2 fans with Spotify login",
