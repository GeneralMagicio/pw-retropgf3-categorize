  "contributionDescription": "My journey with Optimism began in April when I embraced the role of a delegate advocating in Twitter Spaces, podcasts, and conducted workshops. I've fostered connections with diverse communities across Latin America. My aim is to empower anyone, regardless of their background, to participate and contribute to Optimism's Governance. I've collaborated with various groups and guided individuals in navigating the governance landscape. I also participated in a mission with H.E.R. LATAM*, offering a workshop on governance principles and guiding aspiring delegates. My passion lies in bridging the gap between newcomers and governance.",

My support served as a catalyst, encouraging potential contributors who may not have otherwise applied. This had a positive influence on communities like Espacio Cripto, Cryptoversidad, H.E.R. LATAM, and Cryptonikas.\n\nFurthermore, I offered assistance to individuals and communities seeking active involvement in Optimism governance, communicating in Spanish. I made the most of every opportunity to promote the Optimism Collective, extending invitations for people to join while emphasizing the valuable contributions from Latin America in enriching the Collective with diverse perspectives.",
