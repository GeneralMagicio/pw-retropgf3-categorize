  "contributionDescription": "We've developed the first audited, production-ready P256Verifier smart contract. Our open-source implementation has enabled developers to create better UX for secure self-custody on Optimism and Ethereum-equivalent L2s more broadly.\n\nP256 ECDSA signatures are available on a wide variety of consumer cryptosystems including Yubikey, Apple's Secure Enclave, the Android Keystore, passkeys, and WebAuthn. This makes P256 signature verification especially useful for smart-contract wallets, enabling hardware-based signing keys and safer, easier self-custody.\n\nSee our blog post (https://daimo.xyz/blog/p256verifier) for a more complete description of the features and under-the-hood details of the verifier.",

  "impactDescription": "The verifier enables secure and friendly self-custody for contract wallets, starting with our own open-source wallet, Daimo.\n\nWe improved the precompile proposal EIP-7212 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212) based on our learnings from P256Verifier and are co-authors. P256Verifier is also the reference implementation for our progressive precompiles idea (https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/prog/14821) for smoother precompile adoption on L2, both for 7212 and more broadly.\n\nWeâ€™ve inspired multiple third party implementations in the developer community, including one in Huff: https://x.com/AmadiMichaels/status/1714418083186548910 and in Vyper: https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1713591896763679155",
