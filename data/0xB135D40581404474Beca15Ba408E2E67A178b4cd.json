These contributions explain Optimism's rollup technology, staking, governance, DeFi integrations, and benefits. My explainers aim to make Optimism more accessible for developers and users. I also created posts and videos to raise awareness of Optimism updates, statistics, partners, and details around the airdrop.

Making information on Optimism easy to digest serves to further its adoption and progress as a key Ethereum scaling solution.",
