  "contributionDescription": "Over the past 6 months we have advanced the Rust tooling for Cannon from a small template repo to a full stack of tooling. This involved the following:\n\n- Changes to support that latest version of Cannon and the updated pre-image oracle\n- A docker builder image for easy cross-compilation of MIPS binaries\n- `cargo cannon` CLI tool to make it simple to bootstrap and build projects\n- Updated API for retrieving pre-image oracle data that is safer and more rust idiomatic\n\nCannon-rs is currently used by ChainSafe Systems and Sygma to develop production applications that use Cannon and the OP stack.",

  "impactDescription": "A number of projects (Sygma, Coinbase Base) are planning to use Rust to develop alternative clients for Cannon and the OP stack. Cannon-rs can speeds up this development by proving low level system APIs for Cannon upon which more complex provable programs can be built.\n\nProviding developers with a way to develop with Rust for Cannon improves adoption and diversity of code that can be proven using Cannon.",
