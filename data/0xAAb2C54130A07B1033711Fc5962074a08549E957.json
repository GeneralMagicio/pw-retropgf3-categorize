  "contributionDescription": "Coinbase’s decision to build and incubate Base on the OP Stack was cause for palpable excitement. At the same time, it brought forth pressing questions:\n\nHow would introducing new chains shift the balance in Optimism’s economics?\n\nHow would OP Chains balance decentralization and neutrality with their own interests?\n\nHow could we remain unified in development efforts, and avoid fragmenting work?\n\nWe’d known that the day would come to transition from a single chain to a Superchain. But this made it real. Our journey to forge ahead with Base wasn't just about answering these questions; it was about setting a precedent.",
