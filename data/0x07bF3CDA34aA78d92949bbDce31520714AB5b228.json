  "contributionDescription": "While there are plenty of Solidity libraries out there, nobody has been working on high-quality, secure, and easy-to-integrate library-like Vyper code. 🐍 snekmate fundamentally changed this! In one sentence: 🐍 snekmate are state-of-the-art, highly opinionated, hyper-optimised, and secure Vyper smart contract building blocks. Or in other words: What OpenZeppelin is for Solidity, 🐍 snekmate is for Vyper. 🐍 snekmate has helped numerous Vyper builders to kick start on the OP stack. Not only does client diversity matter but also language diversity!",

Did you need an ERC-20 Vyper implementation for Optimism? Use 🐍 snekmate. Did you need some fancy math functions in Vyper for your AMM/DEX on Optimism? Use 🐍 snekmate. To put everything in one sentence: 🐍 snekmate has been the go-to-source for any Vyper code and ensured the security of the contracts with over 16k lines of unit, fuzzing & invariant tests. 🐍 snekmate has ensured that Vyper contracts deployed on Optimism follow the highest security standards and best practices.\n2) 🐍 snekmate has become the go-to-source for educating and understanding Vyper code. The entire code base is enriched with explanatory comments, making it easy to grasp.",
