However, as I listened to the core team at events like EthGlobal, EthDenver, and various others, I started to understand how open-source initiatives can establish digital country and have a global impact.\n\nFueled by this, I began translating nearly every document into Thai and using my Photoshop skills to create eye-catching art that grabbed people's attention. This effort convert normal user into loyal followers who are still with me today. As a result, my Twitter account and content on other platforms have grown and become one of the most trusted sources for the Thai community.",
