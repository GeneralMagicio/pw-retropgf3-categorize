  "contributionDescription": "At Optimism Korea, our primary focus is breaking language barriers and cultivating the Korean Optimism builder community.\n\nTranslation: Language remains a formidable challenge for non-English-speaking builders. We're addressing this by translating all developer documentation and Mirror on Optimism's blogs into Korean. This initiative empowers developers and users to grasp Optimism's vision and actively contribute.\n\nBuilder Community: We've initiated the formation of an Optimism builder community, starting with our team of 8 experienced Optimism developers. Additionally, we plan to organize Developer Meetups to welcome newcomers.\n\nOur contributions are geared towards empowering and expanding Optimism's presence in the Web3 ecosystem while bridging language gaps.",
