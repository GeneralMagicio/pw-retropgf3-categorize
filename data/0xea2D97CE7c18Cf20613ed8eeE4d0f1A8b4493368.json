I can only do my part to spread factual information, offer them knowledge and hope more people realise how their dreams is actually within reach, and the potential this world could become, if we collectively use it to make life easier for people. Ofcourse, for the people using the tools for unethical purpose, we'll and I believe should be duly punished. But we cannot let that fear blind majority with once in a life time opportunity and resources we all could only dream of just couple years ago.",
