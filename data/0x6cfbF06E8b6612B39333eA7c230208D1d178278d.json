  "contributionDescription": "1. We won OP's hackathon prizes and keep building it into a game-like digital world where players are 3D avatars to continue their web3/NFT adventures in a playful way. NFTs are usable in players' inventory. Tokens are keys to unlock access and gameplay. \n\n2. Another World is an OP+OP-stack game. Game items are NFTs airdropped via Optimism Mainnet. Our OP-stack is built for treasure-hunt battles where players win or lose on-chain items. We also supply in-game $OP airdrops for players who retrieve certain game items.\n\n3. Another World showcases a simplified UX for both web3 and web2 players to enter a 3D world. Web3 players opt-in by typing in ENS at the entry menu while web2 users are free to play using an URL. \n\n4. Our progress and game sample codes are open-source on GitHub.",

We showcased the shortest path from the official website to entering a 3D world using a web browser. Players can experience the gameplay first before using their wallets.\n\n4. Our open-source Unreal Engine game sample and in-game airdrop mechanism (serverless + contracts) can bring more game devs into the ecosystem and reduce the friction of in-game token airdrops.",
