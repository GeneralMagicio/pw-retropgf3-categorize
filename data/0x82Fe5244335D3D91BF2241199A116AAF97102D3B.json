Our development team have contributed to Balancer, Badger, and other leading DeFi protocols. The launch of Golden Boys on Base has crystallized our activity on the OP stack and created a committed team of developers who are new to the Optimism Collective. We are excited to help build the DeFi ecosystem on Base.\n\nEnd User Experience & Adoption\nGolden Boys has brought hundreds of new users to Base. Many of these members bridged to Base the first time to participate. Our project has developed the deepest WETH/USDC liquidity on Base, a necessary asset to future growth on Base. \n\nA major DeFi player, Humpy, has also come to Base as our founder.",
