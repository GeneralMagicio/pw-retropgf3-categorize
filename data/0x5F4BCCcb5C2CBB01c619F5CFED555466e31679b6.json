  "contributionDescription": "We have launched a campaign on QuestN to translate the OP Friday Twitter Threads posted from 1 September to 20 October 2023, which consists of 8 threads over 8 weeks, into various native languages.\n\nThe Optimism Foundation releases a weekly update on the official Optimism Twitter account every Friday. However, these updates are only posted in English.\n\nTo address this, Opti.domains and Bored Town have partnered to launch a campaign on QuestN. The aim is to translate these OP Friday Threads into over 20 languages and compile high-quality translations into the first edition of Bored Post's multi-lingual magazine.\n\nParticipants are tasked with translating an OP Friday Twitter Thread into their native language. They must then share their translation on Twitter to receive rewards.",
