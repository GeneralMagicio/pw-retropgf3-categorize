The V2 was also deployed to Optimism on 10/19/23.\n\nIn July 2023, we deployed the first-ever cross-chain wallet controlled by a community or smart wallet using Lit Protocol on the Chronicle OP L2 testnet.\n\nWe learned on mainnet (with over 1000 groups) that mainstream communities wanted to engage their members to crowdfund a transparent treasury and crowdsource decisions to reward contributors, play w/ nfts, etc. But they ran into 3 issues.\n\n#1 — Transaction costs were prohibitive \n#2 — Onboarding experience was intimidating mainstream.\n#3 — Opportunities were fragmented across many chains and often only available to EOA wallets.",
