  "contributionDescription": "We've created 13 reusable modules in our Inverter Open Library, along with 3 workflow templates, allowing projects to easily implement adaptable smart contracts without the hefty investments typically needed for development and audit.\n\nHere are the projects that are currently on testnet and using Inverter to deploy on Optimism:\n- Bloom Network configured an “autonomous bounty payment system” for impact work for its 15K+ non-web3 members. \n- Bonding Curve Research Group has deployed an “investable workstream workflow” to enable bonding curve powered investments for open-source RnD teams without DAO overheads.\n- Crossify is integrating “recurring payroll management workflow” to facilitate subcription management.",

  "impactDescription": "Smart contracts' scalability suffers due to costly, slow development and composability issues, hindering real-world applications. With 152 of 195 countries being developing, reducing blockchain entry barriers is vital for global adoption. Inverter's modular infrastructure significantly cuts down smart contract setup time and running costs for new applications.\n\nWe onboarded projects that are building on Optimism by making it possible to deploy web3 products in an agile way. With Inverter workflows, implementing smart contracts is only configuration process, rather than engineering challenge: \n- No more need to individually finance audits and security protocols \n- No more need for dedicated smart contract team or timely development cycles to implement new features or modify the old ones.",
