  "impactDescription": "- The glossary has made it straightforward to look up terms that someone is unfamiliar with, making it easier to get a basic understanding of concepts and terms that are a prerequisite for meaningful participation in the Collective.\n\n- The directory of Optimism tools and resources has increased the visibility of many great resources that are enormously valuable yet not enough people people know about. By having an open contribution form on the website, we have also fostered a culture of collaboration with individuals and organizations like the USC Blockchain Club submitting links to resources.\n\n- The RetroPGF micro lesson, which takes roughly 7 minutes to finish, was successfully completed 38 times.",
