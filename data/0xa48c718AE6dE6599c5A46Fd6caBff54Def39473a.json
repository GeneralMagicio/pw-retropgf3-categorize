Coinpassport makes it easy to provide a strong signal to your individual humanity by linking your passport to your Ethereum wallet. For a fee of 3 USDC, Coinpassport uses Stripe Identity to verify your face matches your passport.\n\nCoinpassport has been live on Optimism mainnet since May 14, 2022 and has received 22 fee payments in that time.",

I have not been able to make contact with anyone at Gitcoin about receiving feedback on this integration.",
