  "contributionDescription": "Delegate has built a transformative platform for users to secure assets while still enabling participation in NFT airdrop claims, ERC20 token governance, and more.  To date, Delegate has secured over 2300 wallets on Optimism. \n\nOur solution is a programmable registry, deployed on Optimism Mainnet.  Users and institutions link their cold wallets with hot wallets on delegate.xyz, and then the hot wallet can act on behalf of the cold wallet, like crypto power-of-attorney.  This allows users to manage all their assets across multiple wallets simultaneously without touching anything in their vault, enhancing security and efficiency across airdrops, governance, gaming, DeFi, and more.  \n\nDelegateâ€™s registry is fully onchain, enumerable, independent, immutable, and verifiable.",

  "impactDescription": "Delegate has improved safety, UX, and reputation tooling for the Collective. Users no longer have to connect their cold wallets/vaults/multisigs to unknown websites, they can \"delegate once, use forever\". This reduces phishing risk and creates a safe NFT/DeFi ecosystem on Optimism, just as we've seen on Ethereum. We've also seen greatly improved UX - by safely interacting from a hot wallet or mobile wallet, users can do low-risk onchain activity like voting or gaming on the go. And onchain reputation, which is critical to Optimism Collective governance, is enhanced by identity clusters formed within the registry.",
