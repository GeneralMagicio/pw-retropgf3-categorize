  "impactDescription": "I believe having the most liquid and highly traded markets is key to a successful ecosystem. There is a natural monopoly that develops for markets that are able to bootstrap and attract the most liquidity and offer their users the best price execution. However, as protocols upgrade, development time is needed to keep up, with very low profit incentive.",
