  "bio": "Local Bloom hubs do food security, relationship repair, and build local economies. Our social network facilitates a networked economy with bounties.",
  "contributionDescription": "Bloom Network, in collaboration with Inverter Network, developed a regenerative action bounties system that rewards grassroots participants for doing real world climate actions. Bounty claims are reviewed by an approved regional verifier who has relationships with people on the ground, and tokens are then automatically issued. This on-chain system can integrate with other impact certification tools such as Hypercerts, to boost visibility of local economic sovereignty work to potential funders and supporters. Bloom designed a token engineering model so tokens can additionally be used as a community currency to circulate forms of surplus in cash-poor communities. Grants and profits from Bloomâ€™s social network can flow into local small scale impact projects, in a trusted, transparent way.",
