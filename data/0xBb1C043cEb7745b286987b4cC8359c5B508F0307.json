  "contributionDescription": "I was a very early supporter of web3 artists, especially in the music industry, having collected/minted a lot of music on various platforms such as Sound, Decent, Zora, Anotherblock, Base,... especially especially when these support the OP blockchain. I currently have thousands of editions music onchain on the OP blockchain in my collection. Not only does this show support for web3 artists, but it also helps me discover and enjoy their unique, creative music.\n\nIn addition, I constantly write reviews, introducing artists and their music to the public so that more people know. My reviews attract a lot of people interested in learning about web3 music as well as collecting onchain music, especially through Sound, the leading web3 music platform today.",
