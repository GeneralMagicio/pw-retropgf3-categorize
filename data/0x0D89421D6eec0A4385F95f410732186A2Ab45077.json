  "contributionDescription": "LexDAO is a club of legal engineering professionals united to bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world.\n\nLexDAO organizes sophisticated conversations and education materials to help orient people around how to build in this new and evolving space. LexDAO focuses on Code is Law applications where practical legal theory is embedded into smart contracts, applications, and networks. The efforts we undertake are all in the spirit of public goods and services. Many of our projects spin out into standalone tools or services; some examples include KaliDAO and Smart Invoice.",

  "impactDescription": "The most significant direct impact to OP are our Real World Asset projects on our sister project Kali. The Kali project, like many other on chain DAO deployers, is a direct spinout from earlier Lex Projects related to onchain governance, arbitration, an corporate structures. The smart contract code is greatly simplified which makes it easier to read and secure assets on chain. \n\nSmart Invoice is a tool that was designed to provides web3 workers with cryptocurrency invoicing, escrow, and arbitration capabilities. As with most things LexDAO produces, it is built in an open source framework so that other developers can build on top of its code.  It is designed for clients and contractors to make the facilitation of crypto-payments easier to use and safer for both parties involved.",
