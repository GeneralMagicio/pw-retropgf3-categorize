  "contributionDescription": "At inbest we are a bridge between the cutting edge blockchain technologies and the end users who do not understand it, sometime is hard to find information other than the extensive documentation that gets to technical for most users.\n\nOur role is to find this information, digest it, and then feed it to the audience on a specific manner that tends to be easier to understand. \n\nIn spanish is even more dificult to find objective and well created content that explains this technologies and how they work so that the regular users gain more interest!\n\nthis will greatly impact the growth and adoption of the SuperChain! \n\nif you type \"la super cadena op\" you will see a lot of \"airdrop\" videos, but only one actually explaining the technology and talking about the op stack in spanish.",
