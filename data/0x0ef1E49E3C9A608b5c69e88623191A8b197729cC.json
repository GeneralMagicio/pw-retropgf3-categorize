Custom user generated lists of themed wallets e.g. “High Volume Optimism Traders”; “Velodrome Power Users”\n3. Token tracking for Optimism assets e.g. $OP, $VELO\n4. Customizable Telegram + Discord alerts for Optimism communities\n\nOptimism was the first L2 Cielo added support for (April 2022) and continues to dominate our operations and user activity. \n\nWe have expanded to include other chains of the OP Stack and have over 45,000 users .\n\nIn August, Cielo became the first wallet tracking service to add support for Base, providing onchain analytics during the L2’s first weeks of operation.",

  "impactDescription": "Cielo sends over 2 million alerts every week to users of the OP Stack (Optimism, Base, opBNB and Mantle). We reach 46,000+ direct users, 500 Telegram groups, and 270 Discord communities.\n\nDuring a 48 hour span of the Base launch, Cielo sent out over 2.5 million alerts to its users.\n\nPower user testimonial from Houston: “I use a number of wallet trackers and to me, Cielo is clearly best in class. It is, to my knowledge, still the only wallet tracker that supports Synthetix perpetual futures on Optimism chain (hosted on frontends like Kwenta), breaking down transactions that take place in brief, easy to understand snippets. Amongst the wallet trackers I use, Cielo was the first to support transactions on Optimism chain.” \n\nWe shared external testimonials in the Contribution links section.",
