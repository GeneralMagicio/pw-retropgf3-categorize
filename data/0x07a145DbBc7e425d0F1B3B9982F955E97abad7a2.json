  "contributionDescription": "Dasy is a lisp for the EVM. It enables smart contract developers to write their contracts in a very convenient lisp syntax that they can mold to their liking with compile-time macros. It transpiles internally into Vyper, so Dasy contracts benefit from all the compiler optimizations in Vyper. ",

  "impactDescription": "Dasy has performed well as an experimental language, already matching the features and gas performance of more mature languages. It has also been a playground for brainstorming syntax features that may or may not make it into Vyper eventually. Because of its lispy nature, these syntax features can be implemented easily as compile-time Dasy macros. If they're good, more robust support can make it into either Dasy or potentially even Vyper itself.",
