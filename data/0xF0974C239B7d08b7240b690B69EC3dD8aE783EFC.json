  "impactDescription": "As the Optimism Collective embraced Superchain, our Launchpad expanded from serving only Optimism to all OP stack blockchains.\n\nOur goal: anticipate the rise of NFTs and eliminate technical barriers. Thus, we support blockchains like Base, Zora, and Base Goerli.\n\nImpacts:\n- NFT Owners: We offer a streamlined platform, lowering entry hurdles.\n  \n- Chain Owners: While creating blockchains is eased by OP stack, developing an ecosystem isn't. Our Launchpad bridges this gap, enhancing business opportunities.\n\n- OP Stack: As a \"Superchain-compatible\" launchpad, we rapidly onboard new chains, showcasing OP stack's ecosystem readiness and competitive edge.\n\nIn sum, Apetimism Launchpad enhances accessibility and growth, aligning with the Optimistic Vision and shaping the digital frontier.",
