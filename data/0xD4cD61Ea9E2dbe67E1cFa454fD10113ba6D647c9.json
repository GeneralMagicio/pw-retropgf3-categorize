  "contributionDescription": "Lorak is live on Mainnet, since the launch of Base, and since has processed over 450k+ TXs in total. We believe that it is now one of the largest onchain games on Optimism overall. Furthermore our development acts as a blueprint for other onchain games to emerge on Optimism. \n\nLorak innovates with in-game state on-chain, experimentation in asset ownership, specifically using 6551-eip in our game we've been able to implement ownership of in-game items tied to the in-game character NFT. Which allowed for an RPG type game to thrive with over 300+ NFTs to find as loot.\n\nBehind Lorak is LandTorn is a gaming hub built on Optimisim Base, acting as a publisher and distributor of games with a focus on on-chain innovation. We are helping other onchain games build towards a future on Optimism.",

  "impactDescription": "Lorak's impact has been felt through over 80k+ In-game character NFTs minted, over 10K unique players interfacing with our game. 410,000+ transactions processed through our contracts. Lorak, part of onchain summer on Base, is an experimental on-chain idle game built using the ERC-6551 standard, testing the limits of Token Bound accounts.\n\nBuilt a new community of game enjoyers on Optimism-Base of over 3K people. \n\nWe believe our impact is not only in the growth and showcase of a successful large scale onchain game, but also in the form of building a community of like-minded people and developers interested in onchain games. Through Landtorn we are building a whole ecosystem of onchain games on Optimism-Base and support their growth with our findings in game development & blueprints.",
