The project is a multi discipline\neffort of cryptography, software and hardware development. All the developments are\nopen source, no patents and several incentives for 3rd party security analysis. The\nproject is still active for providing improved implementations.",

  "impactDescription": "The Keccak hash function, and all its derivations, are cryptographic building blocks for\nthe good of the society. We believe that open cryptography is a key technology for the\ndigital society. The security of Keccak is key to the security of Ethereum and of many\nother digital projects. We worked a lot in analyzing its security and encouraged third-\nparty cryptanalysis, with very positive results.\nThe Keccak hash function is one of the most analyzed cryptographic functions, which gives a very high confidence on its security and resistance against all kind of attacks.",
