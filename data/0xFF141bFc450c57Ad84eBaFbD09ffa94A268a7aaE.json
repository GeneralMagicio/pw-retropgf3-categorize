  "contributionDescription": "I am Xofee, a mechanical artist, creating marvels like the 'Opti Maze,' 'KZG Marble Machine,' and 'Onchain Illusion,' each narrating significant blockchain milestones. \nMy project, the 'KZG Marble Machine,' was crafted for the KZG ceremony, a pivotal moment in enhancing Layer 2 capacities on Ethereum. It encapsulated the blockchain's essence, creating a useful spectacle appreciated and featured in notable podcasts like Bankless' Weekly Rollupâ€™ and the Daily Gwei.\n'Opti Maze' was a tribute to Optimism on OPcraft. 'Onchain Illusion,' created for the Onchain Summer event, symbolizes the amalgamation of art and blockchain.\nThrough the RetroPGF 3 initiative, I seek to secure support that will further fuel my quest to blend the abstract blockchain concepts with tangible mechanical artistry.",
