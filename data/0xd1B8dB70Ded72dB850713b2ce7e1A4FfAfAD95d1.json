  "contributionDescription": "Pairwise simplifies complex decision-making by presenting only two projects at a time for list creation. This method eases voting and introduces a system where citizens can project lists with budget allocations. Offering a solution to the RetroPGF 2 challenge of assigning percentages to 196 projects for example, Pairwise divides and reduces workload by categorizing projects and emphasizing individual expertise so that citizens can focus their vote on their areas of knowledge, ensuring both simplified and informed voting. The algorithm mirrors the Elo system used in games like League of Legends, where project comparison leads to more precise decisions.\n\nWe've crafted a completely new game experience for citizens, and we're eager for citizens to explore it.",
