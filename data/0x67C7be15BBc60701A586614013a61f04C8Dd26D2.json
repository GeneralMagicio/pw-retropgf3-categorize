Optimism Mainet helped me solve this problem\nThe second thing is: Testing and feedback: Use applications, games... on the OP platform, identify any game issues, bugs or usability issues and provide valuable feedback to help improve the Apps.\nThe third thing is Community Building: Interacting with the community, individuals on X platform, telegram..., answering questions, promoting a positive and harmonious community environment import.",
