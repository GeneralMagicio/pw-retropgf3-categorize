  "contributionDescription": "Web3 is hard to use. Self-custody and interacting directly with the blockchain today is overly complicated for the consumer, leading to the average user losing their funds and quitting the ecosystem. UX today is fraught with “gotchas” and pitfalls.\n\nFire - the Chrome extension that simulates transactions, showing you exactly what will go in and out of your wallet before you sign the contract.\n\nWe protect wallets on Optimism and Base today. We want this number to grow, helping support the Optimism ecosystem as well as onboard new users to it!",
