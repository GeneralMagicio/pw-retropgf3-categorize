This fall, 30 million OP will be distributed to builders, creators, and educators who have provided positive impact to the Optimism Collective. If you want to get started building, head to our Ecosystem Contributions board to find a project.\n\nOptimism is building an economy that empowers community members to be recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the Collective. These regular rounds of RetroPGF are key to growing Optimism’s economy, and eventually, to scaling the principle of “impact = profit” to the world.",
