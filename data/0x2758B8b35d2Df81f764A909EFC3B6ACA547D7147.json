I have been involved in building a community for people who share the same passion and belief in Optimism in Vietnam.\n\nWe have been building and supporting the adoption of OP and its applications, such as in music. I am one of the co-founders of the Camel Venture fund, a familiar name within the music community on Sound.xyz.\n\nOn a personal level, I have also been involved in supporting and answering questions from members within and outside the community to help them better understand the platform's workings.\n\nIn the near future, I plan to continue developing additional support for artists in Vietnam so that they can develop and release music products on the Optimism blockchain platform and Sound.xyz.",

We were able to raise nearly 30 ETH, which may not be a large amount, but it is a great achievement for us considering the web3 music market is still in its early stages and not many people are aware of it or know much about it.",
