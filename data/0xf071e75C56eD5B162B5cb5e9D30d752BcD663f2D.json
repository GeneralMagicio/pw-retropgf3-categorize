  "contributionDescription": "In September 2021, we identified a fragmented Crypto Job landscape, with many sites charging for postings, thus sidelining smaller protocols. In May 2022, our self-funded team unveiled JobStash, a platform for publishing jobs for both emerging and established protocols. We index vacancies from organization career pages, thus eliminating scams and the need for their direct involvement, and do not require financial contributions to list jobs.\n\nWe index  >4K jobs from 224 organizations deploying on 50+ chains. \n14 of these organizations deploy on Optimism.\nWe publish to >5k TG subs daily.\n\nUsing AI, we structure job details and add in both manually-researched data, like organizational headcounts, and auto-imported data, such as funding specifics, protocol financials, audits and hacks.",
