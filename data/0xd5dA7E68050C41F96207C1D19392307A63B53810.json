  "contributionDescription": "I have been holding and accumulating OP from the beginning of the issuance to now. I am always paying attention to the development of OP. I have subscribed to MIRROR and purchased NFT. As the second-layer network of Ethereum, I believe there will be more supporters! As a supporter of OP, I hope that more friends will join OP’s team. Of course, there are more competitors in the second-tier network than OP, such as ARB. Of course, I hope that OP can win in the numerous competitions. Stand out and hope to have the same bright future as Ethereum! This requires the joint support and efforts of you and me! ! ! If I am lucky enough to receive an airdrop, I will invest in OP for a longer period of time. In fact, the development of OP is inseparable from cryptocurrency support ",
