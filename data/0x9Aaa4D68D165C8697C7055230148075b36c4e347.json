  "contributionDescription": "We are creators and maintainers of the open-source frameworks UseDApp, a framework for decentralized application development\n\nUseDapp has helped developers build complex multichain application support without a struggle. It supports almost 70 different chains, including Optimism, Optimism Goerli, and Optimism Kovan, improving developers' ability to build and test dApps. UseDApp was the first framework to use Multichain calls which lead to broader blockchain call optimizations. \n\nUseDApp also created a set of useful hooks and helpers that made it even simpler and faster to integrate with different existing standards like ERC20 e.g. useTokenBalance, and useTokenApprovals.",
