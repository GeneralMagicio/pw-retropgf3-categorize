  "contributionDescription": "In the last year, we completed a first iteration of a public goods funding structure targeting the advancement of private data transfer. \n* Set up an advisory committee and program structure\n* Disbursed 750k to research groups working on private information retrieval and homomorphic encryption.\n\nThis fund both advances a clear, narrow, mission and serves as a test case for the public goods funding discussion at protocol labs and more broadly around the funding the commons community.\n\nNote on the existing grants / funding: 100% of the initial startup funding has been treated as funds for grant-making. The entity has run so far with 0% overhead, and has not provided compensation to the advisory committee or program officers.",
