Or even many people who are better than me. and from the total engagement amount in the tens of thousands It made me quite satisfied with the response that exceeded my expectations. At least there should be people who get to know a little more optimism than before. It would be good. In addition to having more knowledge I also hope that those people will continue to spread good things.",
