The fee (1%) is the lowest among all NFT Markets on Optimism. \n2. opxVELO - the only liquid staking project for VELO, offering users and projects access to veVELO without the time commitment of locking and managing a vote-escrowed position.\n3. Auto-compounding vaults, featuring the lowest fees (7%) on Optimism.\n4. Our UI / UX. UI hosting is possible only with project revenue.\n5. I would like to nominate Alex, our only developer, for RPGF. He brought two years of web3 experience to Optimism without incentive. He has never received outside funding of any kind. He often competes with projects with sizable backing and incentives. ",
