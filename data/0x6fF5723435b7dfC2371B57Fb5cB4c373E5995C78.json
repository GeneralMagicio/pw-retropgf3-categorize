  "contributionDescription": "I am a graphic designer, writer, and entrepreneur passionate about art. In June 2021, I embarked on my journey as an NFT artist, and it eventually became my full-time occupation, with my projects primarily on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nIn June 2022, I launched my first project, 'Bored Town,' on Optimism, recognizing it as an ideal platform for NFTs due to its lower gas fees. I leveraged NFTs to promote businesses and events, using my art and marketing initiatives to attract new users to Optimism. As both an artist and the founder of a pioneering project on Optimism, my work garnered attention from companies and projects in the web2 realm, allowing me to introduce them to the world of web3 through Optimism Stacks.",
