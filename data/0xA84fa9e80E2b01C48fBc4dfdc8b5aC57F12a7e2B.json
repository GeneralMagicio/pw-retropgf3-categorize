  "impactDescription": "By onboarding Thai people to Optimism and the OP stack chain, I've enabled individuals. Who mainly were priced out of the ETH mainnet, even in a bear market due to the low income in my countryâ€”to have the same level of access to high-quality DeFi dapps on Optimism L2 just like people in developed countries.\n\nMoreover, by doing this, I also bring people into the Ethereum ecosystem, helping them achieve the financial freedom they desperately need.",
