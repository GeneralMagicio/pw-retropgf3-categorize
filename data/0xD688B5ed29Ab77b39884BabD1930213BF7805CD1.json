  "bio": "Base Punk is a dynamic, community-driven NFT project aiming to reshape the world of digital art and social networking on the web3 frontier. ",
  "contributionDescription": "Base Punk is not just an NFT project; it's a rebellion against the ordinary . In just three months, we've grown to over 10,000 followers, held remarkable Onchain Summer events, and received a generous 2 ETH grant from @Buildonbase. Our NFT collection sold out, establishing us as an OG collection in the Base ecosystem. We swiftly introduced .basepunk domains, granting free minting to our NFT holders.\n\nThe Base Punk Chat DApps ( which is assessable to .basepunk domain holder only) launch brought innovative features, such as minting posts as NFTs, allowing users to earn ETH and activity points, soon to convert to $bpunk tokens. We also unveiled a token send feature for seamless transactions.\n\nWith these milestones, Base Punk is reshaping the NFT space and leading the way in Web3 innovation.",
