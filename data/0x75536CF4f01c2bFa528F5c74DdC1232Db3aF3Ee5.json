  "contributionDescription": "Season 4 has been an inflection point for the grants program, during which the review process went from a system that worked in theory to a system that is strengthened by practice.\n\nOn average, the Cycles in Season 4 saw a nearly 30% increase in proposals relative to Season 3 Cycles. There were more than 350 total proposals processed by the Grants Council in Season 4, relative to approximately 150 proposals processed in Season 3.\n\nThe Council scaled its process to accommodate the growing demand for Optimism grants. Each sub-committee refined rubrics tailored to the goal of Intent 2 (Innovating on Novel Applications), and the reviewers learned how to provide robust, yet efficient reviews to manage substantial growth.  We also piloted demand-based granting through the RFG program.",

The council has also been able to create more accountability for grant usage through milestone based tracking and distribution.  Overall, the grants council has reduced the workload of Token House delegates, enabling them to focus their energies on high-impact votes.\n",
