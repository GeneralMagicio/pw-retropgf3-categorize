Our collaboration with Velodrome Finance stands as a testament to innovation, illustrating how Velodrome can serve as a liquidity hub, inspiring other protocols to launch on Optimism. Embodying the true spirit of \"optimism\", we've championed community growth: from assisting newcomers with wallet setups, sharing knowledge about other protocols, to helping developers aspiring to make their mark on Optimism.\n\n",
