  "contributionDescription": "WOOFi has driven a consistent stream of new users into Optimism, now responsible for $64M of assets crosschain swapped into the ecosystem. In doing so, we have flooded Optimism with more unique active wallets and allowed native protocols to reach new audiences.\n\nWOOFi has provided leading single-sided yield for the OP token. We enabled users to lend their OP tokens to a professional market maker and earn hassle-free yield without impermanent loss making it a more enticing asset to own.\n\nWOOFi has generated $400M+ trading volume with as little as 6 supported assets and $1M in TVL. This unmatched capital efficiency has made WOOFi a revered liquidity source in Optimismâ€™s DEX landscape, empowering traders with best pricing and accounting for 10% of the entire network's daily DEX volume.  \n",
