They may also be incorrect. \n\nTherefore, Optimists cannot compare DeFi with confidence.We encourage them to invest in DeFi by providing APY and ROI based on actual investment results.\n\nTo track actual investment results, we make a deposit in stablecoin pools and calculate APY by profit data obtained from smart-contract.\n\nWe already track the actual investment results of 1612 stablecoin pools and track the most pools compared to other sites.
