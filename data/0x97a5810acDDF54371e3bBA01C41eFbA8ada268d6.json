  "contributionDescription": "There was no simple solution for the Optimism community to create and manage 6551 token-bound accounts. We built 6551 Studio so anyone using Optimism can turn any NFT they own into a smart wallet with one click and manage their collections with an intuitive drag-and-drop UI. \n\nWe believe 6551 token-bound accounts will be a standard during the next bull run and want everyone on Optimism to have the ability to participate in the evolution of NFTs.",
