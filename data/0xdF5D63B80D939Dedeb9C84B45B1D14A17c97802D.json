  "contributionDescription": "We're a DAO accelerator for patient communities, and we've crafted two tools on Optimism:\n\nToken Vesting Contract: It allows bounties for patient contributors, ensuring long-term commitment while granting immediate voting rights. This promotes genuine community participation over speculation.\n\nNFT Badges via Otterspace: To meet Swiss regulations, we issue NFT badges post KYC/AML checks for contributions over 1,000 Swiss Francs. The NFTs, with embedded metadata, ensure contributors are verified, making the donation process seamless and compliant.\n\nYour support can amplify our community-driven mission.",

  "impactDescription": "At our DAO accelerator for patient communities, our contributions on Optimism have been twofold:\n\nToken Vesting Contract: Deployed on Optimism, this not only saved costs but also optimized transaction speeds. It promotes genuine, long-term community involvement by providing immediate voting rights to contributors, aligning with Optimism's ethos of community empowerment.\n\nNFT Badges via Otterspace: To streamline the compliance process, we used Optimism for efficient NFT minting, ensuring that sizable contributions remain transparent and trustworthy. This approach has showcased Optimismâ€™s potential in regulatory use-cases, further diversifying its applicability.\n\nOur efforts aim to enhance Optimism's community-centric vision.",
