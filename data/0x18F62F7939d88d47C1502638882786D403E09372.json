A good voting experience is core to supporting the work of badgeholders and ensuring an accurate RetroPGF process.  \n\nRound 2 of RetroPGF put a high burden on the voting experience of badgeholders, requiring them to do a lot of manual work spreadsheets and forms.  This friction limited the overall accuracy of the RetroPGF round.",
