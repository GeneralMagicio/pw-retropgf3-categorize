  "contributionDescription": "We are working towards achieving full Solidity and Ethereum tools redundancy, and more importantly portability across various networks, enabling teams to start building instantly and move across the Web3 space with ease, focusing on their project and core value they are creating, instead of spending a significant amount of their time building up infrastructure or tooling they need for the job at hand.\n\nHaving a full-fledged development environment and a robust infrastructure with all the necessary tooling is and will continue to be one of the most important factors in maturing not just the Optimism stack but Web3 as a whole, bringing in new users and projects based on real value, in a sustainable and retentive fashion.",
