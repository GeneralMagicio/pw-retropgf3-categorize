  "contributionDescription": "ShapeShift DAO contributed to Optimism in two primary ways:\n\n1. Integration of OP Mainnet across ShapeShift's open-source stack in February 2023. \n\n2. Implementation of an OP Growth Grant (Cycle 11) for a novel incentive program executed in partnership with Gitcoin Passport and Thrivecoin. A no-sale rule was implemented by the Growth Council starting in Cycle 10, and ShapeShift DAO therefore shouldered all building costs associated with this program to support the End User Experience & Adoption of Optimism.\n",
