  "bio": "I create educational content about the Ethereum ecosystem in German. My goal is to onboard more Germans to web3 by providing them guidelines (i.e. ab. Optimism)",
  "contributionDescription": "Given that much of the content surrounding Optimism is primarily in English, a German-focused resource fills a gap, that I consider important. Currently, I have about 60 members in my community that I educate about L2s and that bought and delegated OP because of me. My plan is to extend the knowledge that I share on web3ma.de to add more value = impact. \n\nAdditionally, I act as a delegate and currently represent 58 addresses. By regularly voting on proposals, I believe I contribute to the health and robustness of OP's governance. I do this because I believe in Optimism, not because I'm trying to get a grant :) ",
