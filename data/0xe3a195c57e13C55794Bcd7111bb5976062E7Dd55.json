  "contributionDescription": "Llama is an onchain governance and access control product that is deployed on Optimism. \n\nUsing Llama, organizations on Optimism can deploy fully independent instances that define granular roles and permissions for executing transactions, known as \"actions\".\n\nLlama instances can adapt to a changing environment by incrementally adding new participants and expanding the set of available actions. Actions include transferring funds, updating a registry, changing protocol parameters, or activating an emergency pause.\n\nLlama's onchain framework is open and permissionless: any org on Optimism can deploy a self-governed Llama instance to create and execute onchain actions. \n\nIn addition to action creation, Llama's app helps users view a public audit trail of roles, permissions, and action history.",
