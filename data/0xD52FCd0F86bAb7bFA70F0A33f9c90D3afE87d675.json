  "contributionDescription": "As beta testers, this group provided numerous valuable contributions to the preparation and readiness of the Optimism Security Council:\n\n- Participated in multiple draft reviews of diverse documents, both internal and external, providing critical feedback on phrasing, procedural clarity, guidelines, and other aspects. \n\n- Volunteered significant time for live rehearsals of Council operations, including mock upgrade approval flows. This hands-on testing surfaced ambiguity in the drafted procedures that could be resolved prior to launch.\n\n- Reported detailed bugs uncovered during reviews and live rehearsals. The issues spanned different areas. Identifying these bugs early was crucial.\n",
