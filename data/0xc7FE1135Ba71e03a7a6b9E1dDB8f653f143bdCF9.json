  "impactDescription": "Jessy's hacker house and the Optimism Collective share a profound synergy in their commitment to Ethereum's sustainable future. While the Collective envisions a world where public goods equate to profitability, Jessy's house actualizes this by nurturing open-source projects. The single requirement for residents of Jessy's hacker house, is that whatever they build, it must be free open source. The house's emphasis on free open-source software resonates with the Collective's retroactive public goods funding, underscoring the belief that true value lies in communal benefits. We challenge traditional notions of profit, advocating for a model where community-driven initiatives and shared benefits define success in the Ethereum landscape.",
