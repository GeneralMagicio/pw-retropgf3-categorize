At that time, Optimism stood out as one of the most promising chains, but it lacked the number of users it deserved. The Layer2 concept was new, and people approached it cautiously. Market conditions were also unfavorable, but another critical factor was the absence of centralized information sources.\n\nOptimismGuru was created to provide consistent and reliable information to users, accelerating the onboarding process.",

We don't have a tangible proof of this contribution but some of the students participated in the blockchain clubs in their schools, some of them invested in the chain and some of them started working with us in the blockchain community management field!",
