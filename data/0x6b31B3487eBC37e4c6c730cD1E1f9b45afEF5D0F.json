  "impactDescription": "Of course I will contribute to expanding community participation through social media platforms, for example Twitter / X app, then I will introduce optimism that one of the best layer 2 protocols is suitable for very long-term assets and is also very useful for daily transaction needs, so Layer 2 protocol products will become the norm. Therefore, I also want to invest in optimism as a very long-term asset, and also carry out daily transactions with optimism because optimism has the advantage of low gas fees. So everyone knows the advantages of OP, and definitely really likes optimism products. ",
