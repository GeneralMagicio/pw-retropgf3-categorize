The adoption by Snapshot ensures that future DAOs using the framework on Optimism will automatically comply with EIP-4824. \n\nEngagement: We collected feedback from the 20+ projects on Optimism, ensuring that the implementation of EIP-4824 aligns with community needs. \n\nAccess: Our technical infrastructure improvements (contract upgrades, integrations with Snapshot & Boardroom, the explorer for Optimism, etc.) have made the adoption of EIP-4824 on Optimism easier. \n\nInnovation: Our work on attestations, grants, delegations, and regulatory interoperability take inspiration from EIP-4824. Multiple Optimism projects including Gitcoin, Tally, OpenZepplin, EAS, Agora, and others are involved in the projects. ",
