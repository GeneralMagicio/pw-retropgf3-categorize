  "contributionDescription": "We want our community to be able to have an airdrop, or at least our voice can reach the hearts of the OP foundation, young and passionate leaders. I hope they understand the importance of music for the next cycle.\nArtists of all kinds have long struggled to support themselves, and NFTs offer a potentially viable way for them to support themselves. The fact that money is involved does not make them securities.\nWe find it important to support new artists participating in Web3.\n",
