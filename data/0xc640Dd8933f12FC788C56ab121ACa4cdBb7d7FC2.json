  "contributionDescription": "[MUD] We have been developing and maintaining MUD, an open-source application framework for ambitious Ethereum applications and Autonomous Worlds. MUD is the core foundation enabling dozens of Optimism and OP Stack projects, including Words3, Primodium, Sky Strife, and Kamigotchi.\n\n[OPCraft] Last year, using the OP Stack and MUD, we built OPCraft â€” a fully onchain voxel game. OPCraft battle-tested Optimism Bedrock before its release, uncovering several bugs, and raised awareness of the OP Stack's potential in gaming and Autonomous Worlds.",

  "impactDescription": "MUD, our application framework, is open-source and is enabling various projects that run on Optimism or the OP Stack, including Words3, an on-chain infinite scrabble (https://words3.xyz), Primodium, an onchain resource management game (https://www.primodium.com/), Sky Strife, Kamigotchi, and more. It was also the framework of choice at the ETHGlobal Autonomous Worlds Hackathon sponsored by Optimism, ETHGlobal, Protocol Labs, and Lattice that took place in May.\n\nOPCraft, our onchain voxel game, was fully open-sourced and launched on the OP Stack in October last year. In 2 weeks, it saw 3.5m tx (~2x the Bedrock testnet) and helped uncover multiple bugs in the OP Stack. It also showed developers the OP Stack's potential for gaming and complex apps (even featuring in a WIRED article!)",
