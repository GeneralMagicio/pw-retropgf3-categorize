As an engaged Optimism community member, I assisted in widening the top of the hiring funnel in an effort to hire high-quality contributors faster!  I did this by compiling hundreds of relevant potential candidates across various platforms.  I found candidates through iterative discussions with the OP Talent Team, the job advertisements, and shared relevant notes.  This is a time consuming activity, however it is one I am honored to do!",
