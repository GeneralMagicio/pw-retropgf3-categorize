With an accompanying JS / TS library.\n- Cross-pollination: novel math, optimization, EVM tricks developed in Solady are ported to other projects across the OP ecosystem.\n- Used by sound.xyz, OpenSea, 0xSplits, Optimism, Friendtech, etc.\n- Learning resource for Solidity inline-assembly.\n\nOverall, Solady empowers Solidity developers to develop harder, better, faster, stronger on OP ecosystem chains.",
