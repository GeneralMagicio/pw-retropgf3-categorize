  "contributionDescription": "Komorebi has already put 150K personal funds into organizing AW House project (hacker house, grant program, hackathon, R＆D lab). Komorebi has teams/communities committed to it. AW is a new space that if incubated well, could find a unique home on Optimism even more than it does today.\n\nAW is a tight-knit group of devs. And Komorebi was able to give feedback to the collective on what is needed technically to make it better. With this feedback, Optimism could make changes so onchain gaming can prosper even more. \n\nKomorebi was able to connect selected AW builders to Kevin and Binji from Optimism. and have been sharing Autonomous World space information. \n\nBuilt OSS onchain hackathon protocol for the autonomous world on Optimism. The first onchain AW hackathon is going to be held on Oct 27-29",
