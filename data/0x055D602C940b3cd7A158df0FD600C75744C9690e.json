  "contributionDescription": "Many talented people don’t trust that their contributions will be equitably rewarded in web3. So they contribute less value, or don’t contribute at all, because their talents are more dependably incentivized elsewhere. \n\nFor 'Thank Optimism', ThriveCoin built trust-less, open, incentive infrastructure that makes it possible to reward contributors proportionate to the value they create. \n\nOP Ambassadors used our tech to create content that helps our Optimism community better understand the value of rPGF grants. Quality content can’t be auto-validated via traditional quests, so it required custom human validations capability to function. \n\nWe far exceeded all impact expectations - attracting significantly more Ambassadors, more quality content, and more engagement than expected.",
