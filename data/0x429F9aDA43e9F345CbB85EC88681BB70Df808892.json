  "bio": "I write about crypto-related topics like governance, sustainability and scaling.",
  "contributionDescription": "I have written over 100 blog posts about rollups and governance, in addition to countless Reddit & Twitter posts, with the caveat they are not specifically related to Optimism but about rollups in general. All my writings are public domain, and anyone can remix/republish/adapt etc as they please. I've been an Optimism Collective delegate since day 1, and governance has been a key topic in my writings in the last year or so, inspired by my work as a delegate, aimed partly at improving Optimism's governance systems and onboarding more people to Optimism's governance. Kindly note that I'm a recipient for RPGF #2, so it may be prudent to consider my more recent writings about topics like governance for RPGF #3. ",

  "impactDescription": "The impact of writers is harder to gauge with metrics. I could post viewing stats and social media numbers, but instead, let me try something different. Here's my pitch: have you, as a badgeholder, read my content and in some way informed & influenced your thoughts and work? Or your colleagues, friends, and teams building on Optimism? It's not for me to say how impactful my writing has been - so I'll let badgeholders be the judge. Kindly also note that I'm no longer active on Twitter, but still write on Mirror, Farcaster and Reddit with a smaller audience than in the past, so you may consider that when you gauge \"impact\". ",
