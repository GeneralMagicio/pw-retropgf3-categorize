  "contributionDescription": "Optimystics contribute to Optimism in many ways, including:\n\n- We created Optimism Fractal, a community dedicated to fostering collaboration and awarding public good creators on Optimism. We host weekly meetings where players coopete to grow Optimism, then we produce videos and show notes for educational purposes.\n\n- We created the OP Fractal Stack, a suite of open source tools that empower communities with fun consensus games for fractal collaboration. These tools facilitate Respect Games during Optimism Fractal meetings and provide a powerful reputation primitive.\n\n- We created Eden Fractal, a community pioneering fractal democracy and coordination games. We’ve hosted weekly meetings for 18 months and produced countless innovations, including epic shows and articles about Optimism!",
