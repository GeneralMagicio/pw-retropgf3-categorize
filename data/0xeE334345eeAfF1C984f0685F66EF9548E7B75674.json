  "contributionDescription": "We have released our demo on the Base chain recently and have attracted over 140 unique players to experience blockchain gaming. This involves users signing in via their preferred wallet and receiving achievements, that are NFTs for completing tasks. The goal of the demo was to make a very easy and fun experience for those new to blockchain technology. They learn the basics of connecting their wallet and then being able to interact with their NFTs on their preferred marketplace. On top of this players are having a blast managing their cities that require upkeep daily that brings them back.\n\nThere are many plans for the future to keep the game engaging but also attract new users to the Base chain powered by Optimism.
