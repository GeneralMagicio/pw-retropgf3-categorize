  "contributionDescription": "The core idea behind retroPGF is to level the playing field between profit-maximizing startups and nonprofit/OSS projects. Profit-seeking entities have an advantage in their potential for an exit, drawing early investment funding and providing incentives for employees. The goal of retroPGF is to create a system that provides the same benefits for nonprofit and OSS projects.\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of retroPGF is creating a “results oracle” — the process that decides which projects receive an exit. We want to experiment with many iterations to refine this mechanism, and today, we are embarking on the first.",
