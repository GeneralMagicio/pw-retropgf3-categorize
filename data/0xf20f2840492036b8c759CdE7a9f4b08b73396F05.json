  "contributionDescription": "I’M NEW HERE, by Sundance-winner  Dan Sickles and Oscar-winner Shane Boris, chronicles the rise, fall, and future of the NFT art movement. Aiming to demystify the cryptosphere and celebrate its pioneers, the film has been dubbed \"the defining film about Web3 culture\" by Raoul Pal. The project also includes NEW HERE SHORTS, an 11-episode artist-profile series, and the “NEWBIE” NFT collection. Designed as an ensemble film, I’M NEW HERE’s story is \"decentralized\", collating over 100 interviews. Still in post-production for a Fall 2024 release, it blends fiction, live-action, 2D/3D animation, and AI. Through private screenings of both the SHORTS and samples of the feature film, the project has already begun to make waves.",
