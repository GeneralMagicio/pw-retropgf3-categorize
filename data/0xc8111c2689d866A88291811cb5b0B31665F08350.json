  "bio": "I am a proponent of crypto through education. In the last two years, I have created free course and articles across different platforms.",
  "contributionDescription": "I built a course platform where anyone can take a free course to learn about Optimism and the amazing OP Stack. This is something that no one has done before, and I believe the general public deserves to know and learn about OP Stack and why massive platforms like Coinbase and BNB Chain chose to build using this software.\n\nThe platform houses free courses. These courses are broken down into smaller video lessons with quizzes in between them. At the end of a course, a student would have been able to benefit maximally from the course and grow a deeper appreciation for the tech behind Optimism and the future of the OP Stack - Superchain.\n\nThis is now a go-to platform for exclusively learning about everything Optimism in a structured way. And its 100% free and will remain so.",
