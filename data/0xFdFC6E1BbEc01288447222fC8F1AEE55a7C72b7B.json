Over 1,000,000 delegation events have been made on Optimism.\n\nThrough on-chain Approval Voting, over 6M OP has been allocated to fund projects in Season 4 in a decentralized manner.\n\nOur app & contract are open source and MIT-licensed for any builder to leverage. Additionally, with the OP’s superchain coming into play — we plan to ship a 1 click deploy governance package for DAOs on top of OP Stack chains.",
