  "contributionDescription": "In my contributions to the Optimism Network, I have primarily used Twitter as a platform to introduce and educate a wide audience about the comprehensive Optimism ecosystem. The main problems I think Iâ€™ve solved were the lack of awareness and understanding of Optimism's value and the need to onboard users effectively.\n\nMy Twitter posts have covered a broad range of topics within the Optimism ecosystem, including the OP stack, partnerships, development, and various community aspects. I've tried to keep it simple and easy to understand so that everyone can get it without using tricky words. This way, both new and experienced users can learn about what Optimism can do.",
