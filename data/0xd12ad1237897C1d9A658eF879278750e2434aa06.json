  "contributionDescription": "EUCI safeguards the public interest by harnessing permissionless blockchains, notably Ethereum and Optimism. Our goal: foster secure innovation by advocating sensible regulations. We urge lawmakers to see the broad societal impact of these technologies. We've fought against harmful regulations, like banning crypto wallets, equating NFTs to securities, or labelling protocols as bank accounts. We explained why these are detrimental and bridged regulatory intentions with the Ethereum community. We've collaborated with global organizations to curb impractical crypto laws because regulation can make or break an industry, and we won't let it hinder this ecosystem.",
