  "impactDescription": "Solow is Latam‚Äôs biggest free crypto academy, with more than 3.2k members on Discord, 30k people learning from our live courses and 100k newsletter opens.\n\nSolow is also one of the largest sources of original content on Optimism in Spanish. We‚Äôve created articles, videos, mini-courses, live sessions, workshops and quests to onboard more people to the Optimism Collective.\n\nBut, while numbers are great, we believe our biggest impact is measurable by the stories of those who walked with us. For many, Solow was the place to learn Optimism. For others, a community to take their first steps, or get their first crypto job. For some, it‚Äôs been all 3 of them.\n\nIf we want to build a new, better system, we need to make sure we don‚Äôt leave people behind. And education is the only way to do it.",
