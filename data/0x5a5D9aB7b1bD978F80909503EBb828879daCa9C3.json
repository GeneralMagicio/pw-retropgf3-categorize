  "contributionDescription": "We have built a registry of more than 300 open source software projects building on Optimism, and created a series of composable impact metrics based on projects' onchain and off-chain work. This makes it easy to track projects' developer activity, onchain user base, and contribution to OP sequencer fees. \n\nThe registry is free, fully open source, and an important building block for reviewing projects, creating RPGF3 Lists, and assisting voters.",

We've created a strong foundation for measuring the activity and impact of open source software contributions in the Ethereum ecosystem. Although our data and analytics platform is less than 3 months old, we've already had outsized impact by helping badgeholders screen RPGF3 applicants, develop \"lists\" of RPGF projects based on impact metrics, and learn more about any project with a Github or smart contract address.
