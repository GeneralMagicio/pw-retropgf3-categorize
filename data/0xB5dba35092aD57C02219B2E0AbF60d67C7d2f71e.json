Key highlights:\n- Ease-of-Use: Our intuitive design promotes active DAO participation.\n- Transparent Governance: We've made DAO decision-making clearer.\nOur app is backed by extensive research on user engagement, utilizing public data from Snapshot. With a focus on delegate accountability—vital for Optimism—we've integrated Snapshot voting and are gearing up to add Governor contracts, enhancing mobile engagement in Optimism's governance. While the app is versatile for many DAOs, Optimism DAO gets special attention. Built without external grants, we aim to democratize DAO governance. Check out our TestFlight link below.",
